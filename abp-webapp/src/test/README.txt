Test source directory for the ABP web app. This source directory includes both unit and integration tests.

Naming convention:
* unit tests are **/*Test.java.  unit tests should only depend on plain java, they should not require database or any kind of container.
* integration tets are **/*IntegrationTest.java. integration tests generally run longer and do usually depend on database and/or web container.
